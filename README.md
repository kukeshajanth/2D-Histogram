Intro to self driving car  Project - Implementing a 2D Histogram Filter using Python

In this project, I've applied the Bayesian Thinking to, sense and move function that are used to implement a 2D histogram filter in Python. 

This project includes the following files:

localizer.py - This contains the code that implements the 2D move.

sense functions. simulate.py - This contains the code for simulating the move and sense functions. 

helpers.py - This contains helper functions for normalizing the grid, checking if the robot is localized, etc.

writeup.ipynb - This Jupyter notebook is used for testing the 2D Histogram Filter
